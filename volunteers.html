      <h1 class="text-center">Sponsoring</h1>
      <p>Sponsoring one of our animals now couldn't be easier!  In the form below simply tell us which resident you would like to sponsor.  Tell us whether you would like to be a monthly (reoccurring) sponsor, or a one time sponsor. Add the amount you would like your sponsorship to be (sponsorships start at $10.00 per month and can be increased by $10 increments to whatever you would feel comfortable contributing towards the upkeep and care of the resident that you have chosen.  If you would like to be a farm sponsor (instead of sponsoring a particular resident), that would be great too!  Sponsorship amounts of $25 or more will receive an 8x10 picture of the resident being sponsored (or if you've chosen a general farm sponsorship, a picture of a resident of your choosing).  All sponsors can also arrange a private visit to the farm at a convenient time.  All  sponsorships can be cancelled at any time. Thank you! </p>

      <h1 class="text-center">Volunteer Program</h1>
      <p>Whether you want to help maintain the horses by helping with ongoing chores,  maintenance/renovations, or you would simply like to periodically come out and enjoy some horsey time, your interest is appreciated and we would love to hear from you.  There's always room here for more hands, and there's a particular need for volunteers who are willing to work with our horses (grooming, handling, even training). <br>Our ultimate goal is first to provide a healthy and safe haven for the horses who reside at the Sanctuary, and a major part of fulfilling that goal is to make sure that the horses here can be handled easily.  These horses have not always had an opportunity in the past to build trust and confidence. We want to bring all of them along so that they easily accept farrier and veterinary care, being trailered, and the other interactions between human and horse that helps promotes a healthy and well adjusted animal.<br>Safety is a primary concern, for both our horses and our volunteers.  Volunteers of all experience levels are welcome.  You can come here to learn and be mentored as well as to instruct and help at all levels.  Anyone wishing to work directly with the horses or provide volunteer mentoring must of course be able to demonstrate that they have the experience and knowledge to safely do so. <br>Please note that we do not allow hand-feeding of treats to our horses.  We do not have any washroom facilities onsite except during our two annual Open Houses.</p>
